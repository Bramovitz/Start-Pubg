.BAT file has to be run as admin if you want it to be able to kill zkcvs.exe - it simply can't without it.
The timeout waits 90 seconds. In case your pc needs a lil longer you can edit the seconds in the file.
There's 1 program I haven't been able to close since it has the same name as pubg itself.
If you have any improvements, let me know!
